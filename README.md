You can find up to 12 cards in some regions of the game. Currently, 10 are normal cards and 2 are gold foils. Gold foils are well hidden and in difficult places.

For their spawn locations, refer to this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12HSBNqhs5jxpzkb7dSoIKIEcEhsx_uTQTDQfCk_Y2_8/edit?usp=sharing
If you already visited in those areas, spawn them via the console with the model name mentioned in the spreadsheet.
